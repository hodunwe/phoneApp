# Project details

This is a project created using React + Vite with Tailwind CSS. Interactivity is implemented as an attempt for the depth point. Currently, the user **is able to type in a city name into the text box and watch the temperature information change accordingly. **

The current HTML/CSS rendition is not fully polished, and NOT all intended interactive features have been fully implemented. The project will be updated in a later day with the following features: 
- The user will be able to interact (scroll) on the daily weather timeline.
- The background / weather icon will change to match the weather type. (Currently, the background and icon style is set by default to sunny)
- There will be animated effects (ease, opacity control) for clicking on a weather card, and clicking on any one weather card will replace the details / timeline currently displayed to the corresponding day on the clicked card.
- There will be additional features for bookmarking a searched location for easy access.
